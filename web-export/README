This directory contains the files used to export the specifications on
  http://specifications.freedesktop.org/

It's mostly three files:

 - specs.idx: information on where to fetch specific versions of different
   specifications (usually from git)

 - update.py: hacky script that uses specs.idx and creates html pages

 - upload.sh: upload the generated files onto the website.

To publish a new or updated spec, add an entry into specs.idx, commit, run ./update.py, then use ./upload.sh <username> <subdir>
