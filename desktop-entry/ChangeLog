2008-09-12  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: reword sentence about characters allowed in
	key names to avoid some ambiguity.
	Patch by Simon McVittie <simon.mcvittie@collabora.co.uk>

2008-03-04  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: bump version to 1.1-draft, so we can publish
	it. See http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14097

2007-09-10  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: fix Icon key in example: it was using the
	.png extension for an icon name. Which is wrong :-)

2007-07-27  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: don't say that the files are encoded as
	lines of 8-bit characters, which is wrong for UTF-8. Use something a
	bit better proposed by Matthias Clasen <mclasen@redhat.com>
	Bug #11417.

2007-05-30  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: s/DESKTOP_LAUNCH_ID/DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID/
	Thanks to Dan Winship <danw@gnome.org> for catching this.
	Bug #11081.

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: scanf behavior is locale-dependent, and the
	numeric type shouldn't be. Specify that the value is a floating point
	number as recognized by scanf in the C locale.
	Thanks to Dan Winship <danw@gnome.org> for catching this.

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: clarify description for the TryExec key.
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009556.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: change "the $PATH" to "the $PATH environment
	variable".
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009552.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: improve the description of the Comment key.
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009440.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: a desktop file of type Application should
	always have an Exec key. Same for Link Type and URL key.
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009437.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: desktop files of type Directory have a
	.directory extension right now (at least in GNOME), but according to
	the spec, this is wrong. The patch fixes this. Also, it removes a
	small part of text explaining the name of a desktop file describing a
	directory.
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009437.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml:clarify a bit the text about keys that only
	makes sense in a specific context. Also, state that the keys should
	not be used outside of this context. For example, the URL key should
	not be present if the type is not Link.
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009437.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: small typo
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009437.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: this changes the type of the version from
	numeric to string. It's needed if we consider the possibility that
	there are some desktop entry files out there using 0.9.x as a value
	for this key. The change doesn't break anything.
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009437.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: UnmountIcon is a localestring key.
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009437.html

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: clarify that lists should always end with a
	semicolon, even if there's only one value.
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009437.html

2007-02-06  Waldo Bastian <waldo.bastian@intel.com>
